        <h2>How a Stunning Deal Was Done <i class="fa-regular fa-futbol futbol"></i></h2>
        <span>Lionel Messi is looking like his old self again.

            After adapting slowly to his new club and league, the Argentina great finally delivered a complete performance in a Paris Saint-Germain shirt this week.
            
            Four months after he left Barcelona to sign a two-year deal with the French club, Messi not only scored twice in the 4-1 win over Club Brugge in the Champions League, he also influenced PSG’s play throughout with his dribbling skills, acceleration and pinpoint setups.</span>
